1. Overview

The system will:

    Allow daily input of available study times.
    Automatically assign topics to review based on a priority algorithm.
    Provide suggested durations for each topic based on complexity, priority, and retention schedule.
    Guide the review process with iterations on mind maps and wikis for active engagement.

2. Core Features
A. User Input

    Daily Time Slots: Users enter the times they’re available for study.
        Example: 2 hours from 10 AM–12 PM.
    Topic Catalog: A list of topics with metadata:
        Complexity Level: Easy, medium, hard.
        Retention Level: High, medium, low (based on forgetting curve principles).
        Connections: Links to related topics for creating comprehensive mind maps.
    Learning Objectives: Users can define goals (e.g., mastering Calculus by midterm).

B. Scheduling Algorithm

    Factors:
        Spaced Repetition: Topics with low retention levels are prioritized.
        Time Allocation: Harder topics are given more time.
        Diversity: Mix different subjects to prevent fatigue.
    Output:
        A personalized schedule with:
            Topics.
            Time durations.
            Suggested tools (mind map or wiki) for each topic.

C. Review Mode

    Mind Map Iteration:
        Create new branches for expanding existing maps.
        Add annotations and cross-links.
        Highlight areas needing further review.
    Wiki Updates:
        Rewrite summaries, add examples, and clarify explanations.
        Include questions or thought prompts for self-testing.

D. Feedback Loop

    Allow users to:
        Rate their understanding after reviewing (e.g., 1–5 scale).
        Note which subtopics need more attention.
    The system adjusts future recommendations based on feedback.

E. Dashboard and Analytics

    Progress Tracking:
        Visualize completed topics, overall progress, and retention levels.
    Time Analysis:
        Display total study hours logged and adherence to schedules.
    Learning Insights:
        Highlight strong and weak areas for focused effort.

3. Implementation Steps
A. Framework and Tools

    Frontend (User Interface):
        Use a web app or mobile app framework (React.js, Flutter).
        Simple and intuitive dashboard for daily inputs.
    Backend (Logic and Database):
        Python with Flask or FastAPI for scheduling logic.
        SQL/NoSQL database to store topics, metadata, and user progress.
    AI Integration (Optional):
        Use GPT models or other LLMs for generating topic explanations or quiz questions.
    Visualization:
        Libraries like D3.js or Graphviz for mind maps.
        Matplotlib or Plotly for tracking analytics.

B. Algorithms

    Scheduling:
        Implement a priority queue based on:
            Retention scores (spaced repetition).
            Available study time.
        Break long study periods into multiple sessions.
    Dynamic Updates:
        Update schedules daily based on completed tasks and feedback.

C. Review Tools

    Mind Map Tools:
        Integrate with tools like Obsidian or use a custom canvas for creating mind maps.
    Wiki Editor:
        Provide an in-app editor with Markdown support for creating and updating wikis.

D. Notifications and Reminders

    Notify users of their daily study schedules.
    Provide motivational messages or tips before starting.

4. Advanced Features (Future Improvements)

    Gamification:
        Add achievements for completing topics, maintaining streaks, or reaching milestones.
    AI-Assisted Summaries:
        Automatically generate summaries for wiki updates based on the reviewed material.
    Integration:
        Sync with calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar).
        Connect with learning platforms (Khan Academy, Coursera) for resources.
    Collaboration:
        Allow group study sessions or collaborative mind maps.
    Voice Integration:
        Enable voice input for hands-free scheduling or feedback.

5. Example Workflow
Day 1: User Input

    Available time: 6 PM–8 PM.
    Topics:
        Calculus: Limits (low retention, high complexity).
        Chemistry: Periodic Trends (medium retention, medium complexity).

Day 1: Output Schedule

    6:00–6:45 PM: Calculus (Mind Map).
        Create a mind map linking the concept of limits to derivatives.
    6:45–7:30 PM: Chemistry (Wiki).
        Update the wiki with trends and examples.
    7:30–8:00 PM: Self-testing.
        Review mind maps and wikis. Rate understanding.
